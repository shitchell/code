      The Halloween franchise is a long running series of horror films that was never intended to be franchise in the first place. Our story begins in 1978 when the the first in an anthology series of halloween movies was released. The movie starred Laurie Strode and the titular Michael Myers. Due to the movie being a smash hit they decided to make a sequel. This was odd because the original plan for the Halloween series was a series of anthology movies with successful ones potentially getting sequels. So the fact that he immedietly deciding to make a sequel to the Michael Myers debut kind of doomed the series to a path that frankly is more mediocre than good. The second movie was the original ending to teh franchise with them killing Michael and Dr. Loomis in the end. With the story of Michael complete they went on and made Halloween III Season of the witch. This movie was hated by almost everyone becasue there is no Michael Myers. People look back on this movie a little more fondly now, but doesn't change the fact that Halloween was now officially a Michael Myers franchise. This continues on with Halloween IV Return of Michael Myers where they reintroduce the titular killer to the big screen. This movie set up a potential new killer to the franchise Jamie LLoyd. This plotline was dropped quickly in Halloween V and VI where they killed Jamie and introduced the idea that there was a cult that worshipped Michael. Everyone hated the cult and the series was dropped cold. Eventually the series returned with Halloween VIII titled H2O. This brings back Laurie Strode and was the proposed the ending of the series, but the movie was a success so we got Halloween IX Ressurections. This movie is bad. Very very very very bad. Busta Rhymes karate fights Michael that is the level we are dealing with. The franchise was once again dead until a remake series was made by director Rob Zombie. These movies tried to huamnize Michael and were genrally good but not fan favorites. This brings us to today we just recently finished a new trilogy that ignores evreything but the original movie. 2018's Halloween is a genuinely good return to form. The sequels Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends are less good but entertaining for someone who knows too much about the Halloween franchise. The final one kills off Michael and even tried to introduce a new killer in the form Corey Cunningham. They killed him because how do you do Halloween without Michael. As it stands there is no update on if we will ever see Michael Myers or the Halloween franchise ever again, but as they say in the movie, Evil doesn't die it changes shape.
